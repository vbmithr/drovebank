DroveBank
=========

# Description of the software

I chose OCaml as the implementation language. Though a functional
language, my implementation is mainly imperative (lots of loops,
global state, etc).

My solution comprise four files:

* drovelib.ml: Some extensions to the OCaml stdlib, and shared types
  and functions between executables.

* drovebank.ml: A daemon that manages the ledger and serves it to
  clients using POSIX sockets.

* droveshell.ml: A simple client to DroveBank supporting
  deposit/withdraw/transfer operations.

* drovestress.ml: A simulation simulating n piggies continuously
  performing random operations on DroveBank.

# Compilation

Use `make`. You need OCaml version 4.01.0 or greater. I could easily
support older versions of OCaml if you need it, don't hesitate to ask
me if it is the case.

If all goes well, you will end up with three symlinks to native
executables in the projects directory:

* drovebank.native: the daemon
* droveshell.native: the simple client
* drovestress.native: the simulation

All executables are self-documented: use <exec_name> --help as usual.

# General overview of the solution

The problem is about designing a bank accounting system that is at
least resilient to power failure.

I decided to reduce this problem to the problem of implementing an
ACID key-value store from integers to integers.

It means that the account ids are represented by an integer, and the
associated cash is also represented by an integer.

I will explain why my this implementation follows the ACID
requirements:

* Atomic banking operations
* Consistency of the ledger
* Isolated concurrent client queries
* Durability of ledger data

This is basically what I can promise to piggies, that their money is
stored in an ACID key-value store.

# (more) Technical description

I use write-ahead logging for ensuring resilience to power failure,
and transactions in order to implement the transfer operation.

The ledger is stored in a file (by default, `drovebank.db`). Only one
process can access this file simultaneously, in practice this is
ensured by a `drovebank.LOCK` file which existence is checked by the
drovebank deamon.

The ledger is represented by a sequence of 16 bytes blocks, each
representing either a deposit or a withdrawal.

Each block encodes the following data:
* account id of the initiator: 61 bits
* type of op (Deposit or Withdrawal): 1 bit
* transaction infos (Atomic, Begin, End, Continuation): 2 bits
* quantity of cash involved in the operation: 64 bits

During boot, the drovebank daemon sequentially reads the ledger and
constructs a hashtable associating accounts ids to cash balance while
checking the consistency of each operation. This can fail for
atomicity reasons (a new transaction starts before the previous one
finishes), or consistency reasons (a withdrawal from an empty account
or an account that has insufficient funds in it).

Then the drovebank daemon listens for clients on its UNIX socket, and
perform requested operations. On each operation, consistency is
checked, and then written to the ledger if valid, or rejected if
invalid. The client is notified of the success or failure of the
operation.

The drovebank daemon uses one POSIX thread per client served, and the
state is protected by mutexes. Nowadays there are much more efficient
ways handle client connections (based on the select/poll/epoll
syscalls), that do not require POSIX threads at all. Unfortunately
this is not bundled into the OCaml stdlib, and thus would have broken
your requirements (and add a ton of "third party" code into the
project :-))

# ACID

## Atomic banking operations

The basic requested operations where `open account`, `deposit`,
`withdraw`, `transfer`.

In my solution, there is no explicit account creation, accounts are
implicitely created when cash is deposited into an account number for
the first time.

Deposit and Withdraw operations are instrinsically atomic, and are
represented by atomic blocks in the legder.

Transfer is a withdrawal followed by a deposit in a transaction (first
block has Begin flag, last block has End flag).

The rules to check atomicity consistency are in `drovebank.ml line 5`,
function `is_acceptable`. It describe the invariant that must hold
between two sequencial blocks, and is pretty self-explanatory.

## Consistency of the ledger

The consistency is checked at boot time, and each time an operation is
received by the client. If a violation of state is detected at boot
time, the daemon stops and notify about the problem.

The function checking consistency is in `drovelib.ml line 217`.

The daemon notify a corruption of the ledger iff:

- The size of the ledger is not a multiple of 16
- There is a violation of atomicity (function `is_acceptable`)
- There is a violation of consistency (withdrawal from an empty or
  insufficiently funded account).

## Isolated queries

Multiple “concurrent” access is permitted by the drovebank daemon, but
access to the ledger is a critical section and is protected by a
mutex, thus operations are processed sequentially. It is possible to
improve on this, for example, read access can be processed in
parallel, as well as operations that do not operate on the same
account ids.

## Durability of data

Durability is ensured by write-ahead logging. The whole ledger is
represented by a sequence of blocks on disk, and a block is only
written when consistency has been checked beforehand. This is
resilient to power failure where partial blocks / partial transactions
are written.

# Bonus points

As it stands, the solution does not validate the bonus points at all.

Scalability is limited by the use of POSIX threads, the only
concurrency primitives available in the OCaml stdlib. What's worse, as
it stands, the OCaml running system only runs one thread
simlutaneously due to the garbage collector's global lock. Efforts are
currently made by the OCaml community to get rid of this limitation
[1].

Resilience to hardware loss could be achieved either by writing
multiple versions of the ledger in different hard disks (not done, but
easy to implement), or using a distributed key-value store (see
below).

To be really scalable, what is needed is a real consistent distributed
key-value store, implemented using algorithms such as PAXOS[2] or
RAFT[3], but this is vastly out of scope for an 8 hours project (at
least for me).

# TODO

If this was a real project, I would also do:

- Fix issues marked with `FIXME` in the code.

- Remove the use of POSIX threads completely, and instead rely on a
  select/poll/epoll based mechanism (and specifically a monadic
  concurrency library such as Lwt or Async).

- Improve the granularity of critical sections (as it stands now all
  operation are processed sequentially although some of them could be
  safely processed in parallel). Note that this issue disappears when
  one does not use POSIX threads at all.

- Quantitative performance evaluation of the efficiency of the program
  (such as measuring the max number of operations per second).
